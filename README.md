# Check Point Quantum Management MCP Server

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers expose a structured, machine-readable API for your enterprise data—designed for AI-powered automation, copilots, and decision engines. By delivering a clear, contextual slice of your security environment, MCP lets you query, analyze, and optimize complex systems without building custom SDKs or parsing raw exports.

## Why MCP for Security?
 
Security Policies often span hundreds of rules and thousands of objects across diverse enforcement points. Understanding, auditing, or optimizing these environments is slow and error-prone. 
MCP changes this: exposing security management data in a modular, context-rich format, ready for AI systems to consume. Enabling the AI to use your data with precision. Ask real-world questions, and get structured, actionable answers—instantly.

## Features

- Query and visualize installed policies, rulebases, and network topology
- Retrieve and analyze access, NAT and VPN rules
- List and inspect objects such as hosts, networks, services, VPN communities, and more

## Example Use Cases

### Regulatory Compliance Checks
“Do my current gateways meet PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or GDPR standards?”  
*→ Returns a detailed gap analysis across your policy layers.*

### Risky Rule Discovery
“Show all rules that allow any-to-any traffic. Highlight unused or disabled rules.”  
*→ Surfaces misconfigurations and expands your visibility.*

### Path Analysis for Access
“Can host 10.1.2.7 access the internet under current policy?”  
*→ Traces real access flows across Access, NAT, and interfaces.*

### Rulebase Optimization with AI
“Review internet-facing rules and suggest which should be tightened or removed.”  
*→ Actionable insights that improve your security posture.*

### Visual Policy Mapping
“Generate a report showing allowed and blocked services across my environment.”  
*→ Delivers structured data for dashboards, reports, and audits.*

## Configuration Options

This server supports two main modes of authentication:

### 1. Smart-1 Cloud (API Key)

Authenticate to Check Point Smart-1 Cloud using an API key.

- **How to generate an API key:**  
  In your Smart-1 Cloud dashboard, go to **Settings → API & SmartConsole** and generate an API key.  
  Copy the key and the server login URL (excluding the `/login` suffix) to your client settings.  
  ![alt text](./resources/s1c_api_key.png)

Set the following environment variables:

- `API_KEY`: Your Smart-1 Cloud API key  
- `S1C_URL`: Your Smart-1 Cloud tenant "Web-API" URL  

---

### 2. On-Prem Management (API Key or Username/Password)

- **Configure your management server to allow API access:**  
  To use this server with an on-premises Check Point management server, you must first enable API access.  
  Follow the official instructions for [Managing Security through API](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R82/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R82_SmartProvisioning_AdminGuide/Content/Topics-SPROVG/Managing-Security-through-API.htm).

- **Authenticate to the Security Management Server** using either an API key or username/password:  
  - Follow the official instructions: [Managing Administrator Accounts (Check Point R81+)](https://sc1.checkpoint.com/documents/R81/WebAdminGuides/EN/CP_R81_SecurityManagement_AdminGuide/Topics-SECMG/Managing_Administrator_Accounts.htm)  
  - When creating the administrator, assign appropriate permissions for API access and management operations.  
  - You can authenticate using an API key (recommended for automation) or username/password credentials.

Set the following environment variables:

- `MANAGEMENT_HOST`: IP address or hostname of your management server  
- `PORT`: (Optional) Management server port (default: 443)  
- `API_KEY`: Your management API key (if using API key authentication)  
- `USERNAME`: Username for authentication (if using username/password authentication)  
- `PASSWORD`: Password for authentication (if using username/password authentication)

## Client Configuration

### Prerequisites

Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't already have it installed.  
You can check your installed version by running:

```bash
node -v      # Should print "v22" or higher
nvm current  # Should print "v22" or higher
```

### Supported Clients

This server has been tested with Claude Desktop, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf clients.  
It is expected to work with any MCP client that supports the Model Context Protocol.

> **Note:** Due to the nature of management API calls and the variety of server tools, using this server may require a paid subscription to the model provider to support token limits and context window sizes.  
> For smaller models, you can reduce token usage by limiting the number of enabled tools in the client.

### Smart-1 Cloud Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantum-management": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/quantum-management-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY",
        "S1C_URL": "YOUR_S1C_URL" // e.g., https://xxxxxxxx.maas.checkpoint.com/yyyyyyy/web_api
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### On-Prem Management Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantum-management": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@chkp/quantum-management-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MANAGEMENT_HOST": "YOUR_MANAGEMENT_IP_OR_HOST_NAME",
        "MANAGEMENT_PORT": "443", // optional, default is 443
        "API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY", // or use USERNAME and PASSWORD
        "USERNAME": "YOUR_USERNAME", // optional
        "PASSWORD": "YOUR_PASSWORD"  // optional
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Set only the environment variables required for your authentication method.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

1. **Authentication keys and credentials are never shared with the model.** They are used only by the MCP server to authenticate with your Check Point management system.  
2. **Only use client implementations you trust.** Malicious or untrusted clients could misuse your credentials or access data improperly.  
3. **Management data is exposed to the model.** Ensure that you only use models and providers that comply with your organization’s policies for handling sensitive data and PII.
